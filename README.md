# Genetic-Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search and optimization technique inspired by natural selection. It uses a population of candidate solutions that evolve over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation. GAs are used to solve complex problems in areas like AI, engineering, and operations research.
